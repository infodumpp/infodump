# Common errors include
{{< box >}}
<u>Bonding</u>
1. The least electronegative is in the center
2. Atoms from 3rd period onwards can have more than octet for valence
3. Try to always fulfill octet- even if it includes dative 

<u>Structure</u>
1. polyatomic ions (made of covalent) are ionic
2. Count the pi and sigma bonds between bonded elements even if not shown (draw them yourself!)
3. Forces of attraction present in ionic aq substance are ion dipole and hydrogen bonding - no ionic
4. Metallic bonds are non-directional

<u>Intermolecular bonds</u>
1. When looking for the largest net dipole moment, look for the most electronegative first 
2. Anything above trigonal planar does not lie on the same plane 
3. All molecules have idid between one another
