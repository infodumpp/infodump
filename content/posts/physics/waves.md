> 1. | Displacement-distance graph    | Displacement-time graph |
| -------- | ------- |
| movement of the wave itself |Showing displacement of a point on a wave    |
> 2. | Frequency   |  Period |
| --------- | -------- |
| # of cycles / s | 1 cycle / unit of time  |
> 3. At equilibrium point, particle is moving the fastest
> 4. At crest and trough, particle is at rest (change in direction)
> 5. Between 2 points in a phase = wavelength
