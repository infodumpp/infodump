> ### Tips / common mistakes
> 1. Average force = Wd/d, 
> 2. Wd is a scalar quantity
> 3. Power is rate of work
> 4. When an object is going uphill, resistive forces hve a horizontal (frcition) and vertical component (gravity)
> 5. Work done has to be in the same direction
> 6. EPE is greatest when extension is the longest, while KE is the lowest
> EPE can be derived from the area under the force-extention graph
> 7. GPE is relative to a point
> 8. Useful energy does not include work done against friction
