# ðŸš¨ Important pointers
{{< box >}}
1. If an object is neutrally charged, + = -
2. (+) charges never move, rather they are deficient in e-
3. Insulators are used to prevent items from being earthed as e- can flow in and out from earth/ e cant transfer
4. Electrons transfer until they reach an equilibrium
5. If an object is negatively charged, it has electrons all through out
