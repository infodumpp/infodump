## ⏳ Before WW1
- Germany had been a great power (Kaiser, ministers, and army)  
  - Kaiser relied on chancellor, chief ministers, and commanders
- The situation worsened due to the Treaty of Versailles (hunger, malnutrition, etc.)  
  - Kaiser and army commanders involved members of the Reichstag in ruling the country  
    - Wanted to shift blame onto the elected politicians

---

## ⏳ 1918
- The Kaiser abdicates on **9 Nov**  
- The next day, the **SPD** became the new leaders  
  - Germany became a **democratic country**
- An **armistice** was signed

---

## ⏳ 1919 (January)
- The **Weimar Republic** was established (1918–1933)  
- First elections of the Weimar Republic  
- An unpopular republic (1919–1923)
  - Ebert’s SPD was the largest party (he became president)  
  - He didn’t have enough members to form a government ⇒ coalition with the Catholic Centre Party + German Democratic Party

### Strengths vs Weaknesses of Weimar Constitution

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|------------|
| Proportional and fair representation (e.g., 20% votes = 20 seats). Most views represented in the Reichstag. | Difficult for one party to gain a majority ⇒ coalition governments ⇒ hard to pass laws |
| Laws had to be approved by Reichstag (prevent abuse of power). | Article 48 could be abused by President (as happened later under Hitler). |

### Political Challenges

- Laws couldn’t be passed
- Hard for any party to gain majority ⇒ unstable coalitions
- Article 48 could be misused (president could bypass parliament)

---

## ⏳ 1921 – Hitler Takes Control of the Nazi Party

- **SA (Sturmabteilung / Brownshirts)**  
  - Ex-soldiers; Hitler turned them into a private army with uniforms & command structure
- **SS (Schutzstaffel / Blackshirts)**  
  - Hitler’s bodyguards, led by Heinrich Himmler

---

## ⏳ 1923
### France Occupies the Ruhr (January)
- French and Belgian troops invaded the Ruhr  
- German workers ordered to strike ⇒ industrial production halted ⇒ currency collapsed (gov printed more money)

  - Impossible to form coalition  
  - Hindenburg kept ruling by decree
